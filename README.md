# Volunteering-App
This is an app that my cousin and I are working on in order to help people find local associations so that they can volunteer their time. 

## -Things this app does: 
Helps user apps to places to volunteer 
Tracks user's volunteering history
Helps associations post their volunteer projects

## -Things this app does not do:
Collect data for selling purposes 
Dote or pay money to either voluteers or associations

This app will be published as soon as we can on Google Playstore, for now, bear with us...
The Spanish version of this app will also be released as soon as we can. 
Note that we will post our changes on GitHub and also post photo or videos on the project on Netlify. 

## Technologies used:
